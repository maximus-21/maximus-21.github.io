  <h3>VoiceAgentBench</h3>
  <p>
    Created the first multilingual benchmark (6000+ spoken queries) to evaluate speech-based agents on
    tool use, multi-turn planning, and adversarial safety across realistic
    agentic tasks.

  <h3>Self-Correcting Reinforcement Learning for Physics</h3>
  <p>
    Developed a two-stage reinforcement learning framework for physics reasoning in which a 
    base policy generates an initial solution, receives step-level error feedback from a verifier 
    model, and produces a revised solution trained via KL-regularized reward maximization.

  <h3>Dynamic Multi-Agent RAG System</h3>
  <p>
    Built an agentic RAG system for long legal and financial documents with
    interleaved retrieval and reasoning, enabling fault-tolerant tool execution
    over multi-hop queries.

  <h3>LLM Agent for Black-Box Tool Access</h3>
  <p>
    Proposed a black-box tool planning framework leveraging program synthesis to generate executable 
    tool-call sequences without actuall API call access, and built an end-to-end agent pipeline integrating retrieval with structured plan generation.

  <h3>HyPost: Joint ASR Post-Processing Framework</h3>
  <p>
    Developed a joint ASR post-processing model for generative error correction
    and inverse text normalization using Llama-2-7B and Mixture of LoRAs.
