I am a Research Engineer at Ola Krutrim, where I work on post-training,
evaluation, and deployment of large language and speech models for production
AI assistants. My recent work includes improving safety, search, and tool
orchestration in real-time systems, and building multilingual benchmarks such as
VoiceAgentBench for agentic speech tasks. My interests include LLM reasoning,
AI agents, speech modeling, and reliable alignment-focused training.

Previously, I worked as a Research Intern at MIDAS Lab, IIIT Delhi (with Prof.
Rajiv Ratn Shah) on improving STEM reasoning in LLMs, and at NTU Speech Lab (with Prof. Chng Eng Siong) on ASR
post-processing and domain adaptation. Across these roles, I have focused on
interpretable, data-efficient methods that improve model robustness in practical
settings. I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics Engineering at IIT (BHU), Varanasi.
