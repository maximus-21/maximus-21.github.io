  <h3>VoiceAgentBench</h3>
  <p>
    Built the first multilingual speech-agent benchmark for evaluating agentic
    voice assistants on tool usage, multi-turn planning, and adversarial safety.
    It includes 6k+ spoken queries across English, Hindi, and five Indic
    languages.

  <h3>Self-Correcting Reinforcement Learning for Physics</h3>
  <p>
    Implemented SCoRe-style two-attempt RL for high-school physics reasoning at
    MIDAS Lab, IIIT Delhi. Small LLMs generate a first solution, receive step-level
    error feedback from a verifier model, then produce corrected outputs trained with
    KL-regularized reward maximization.

  <h3>Dynamic Multi-Agent RAG System</h3>
  <p>
    Built an agentic RAG system for long legal and financial documents with an
    interleaved retrieval-reasoning strategy. Added fault-tolerant tool-calling and
    retrieval memory to improve multi-turn performance and robustness.

  <h3>LLM Agent for Black-Box Tool Access (SwissNYF / TOPGUN)</h3>
  <p>
    Developed a tool-planning method for black-box settings using program synthesis,
    and built an end-to-end pipeline with tool inventory, retrieval, and planning for
    multi-step agentic execution.

  <h3>HyPost: Joint ASR Post-Processing Framework</h3>
  <p>
    At NTU Speech Lab, built a joint GER + ITN ASR post-processing framework with
    Llama-2-7B. Curated a 400K-example training dataset and used Mixture of LoRAs
    (X-LoRA) for stronger out-of-domain adaptation.
