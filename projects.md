  <h3>VoiceAgentBench</h3>
  <p>
    Developed the first multilingual benchmark for evaluating speech-based AI agents on tool usage, multi-turn planning, and adversarial safety. The dataset contains 6k+ spoken queries across English, Hindi, and five Indic languages, enabling systematic evaluation of SpeechLMs in realistic agentic scenarios.

  <h3>Self-Correcting Reinforcement Learning for Physics</h3>
  <p>
    Built a two-stage reinforcement learning framework for physics reasoning where models generate an initial solution, receive step-level error feedback, and produce a corrected answer. Trained using KL-regularized reward optimization to improve reliability and reasoning accuracy in small language models.

  <h3>Dynamic Multi-Agent RAG System</h3>
  <p>
    Designed an agentic RAG system for long legal and financial documents with interleaved retrieval and reasoning. Implemented fault-tolerant tool calling and retrieval memory to improve robustness and multi-turn performance on complex queries.

  <h3>LLM Agent for Black-Box Tool Access (SwissNYF / TOPGUN)</h3>
  <p>
    Developed a black-box tool planning method using program synthesis and built an end-to-end pipeline with tool inventory, retrieval, and planning for multi-step agent execution without requiring access to tool internals.

  <h3>HyPost: Joint ASR Post-Processing Framework</h3>
  <p>
    Built a joint ASR post-processing model for generative error correction and inverse text normalization using Llama-2-7B. Curated a 400K-example dataset and applied Mixture of LoRAs for improved domain adaptation and out-of-distribution performance.
