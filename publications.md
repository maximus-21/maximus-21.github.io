Selected publications and preprints:

1. **VoiceAgentBench: Are Voice Assistants Ready for Agentic Tasks?**  
   *Dhruv Jain\*, Harshit Shukla\*, Gautam Rajeev, Ashish Kulkarni, Chandra Khatri, Shubham Agarwal*
    A comprehensive benchmark evaluating large-scale speech language models (SpeechLMs) on realistic agentic voice tasks covering multilingual understanding, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn dialogues, and safety robustness.
   [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07978) · [GitHub](https://github.com/ola-krutrim/VoiceAgentBench)

3. **Improving Physics Reasoning in Large Language Models Using Mixture of Refinement Agents**  
   *Raj Jaiswal\*, Dhruv Jain\*, Harsh Parimal Popat, Avinash Anand, Abhishek Dharmadhikari, Atharva Marathe, Rajiv Ratn Shah* 
   AAAI 2026 TrustAgent Workshop
   Introduces a novel refinement framework (MoRA) for physics reasoning that iteratively corrects errors in LLM solutions, significantly improving performance on physics reasoning datasets.
   [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00821)

5. **SwissNYF: Tool Grounded LLM Agents for Black Box Setting**  
   *Somnath Sendhil Kumar, Dhruv Jain, Eshaan Agarwal, Raunak Pandey*
   Proposes SwissNYF, a black-box planning suite for LLMs that leverages program synthesis to plan and verify tool usage without direct access to tool implementations, addressing irreversible and long-running API interactions. 
   [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10051)
